## ❤️‍🔥 Motivation

As a crypto trader, I understand the importance of tracking my investments and maintaining privacy. That's why I have taken the initiative to create a free, open-source cryptocurrency tracking tool that operates locally, keeping all data secure and private on the user's device. I believe that this solution addresses the concerns of many traders and I am looking forward to share it you.

## ❗️ Disclaimer ❗️

Coineda does not provide tax, legal or accounting advices. The provided dashboard and rudimentary tax calculations may contain errors, are incorrect for your country or doesn't cover all tax relevant regulations. Those calculations are developed to the best of my knowledge but I'm not a tax expert and I do not take any responsibility for incorrect calculations.
